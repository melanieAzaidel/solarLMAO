This repository is a collection of Python files, Jupyter Notebooks, and data files for calculating the spectrum of scattered electrons due to solar <sup>8</sup>B neutrinos in Super-K. Please direct any questions to Melanie Zaidel (zaidel.3 [at] osu [dot] edu).

Short tutorials on <sup>8</sup>B neutrino Production and Detection can be found in the corresponding Jupyter Notebook (*.ipynb) files. The Notebook Tutorial-Detection.ipynb contains our calculation of the scattered electron spectrum compared to Super-K's Monte Carlo model of their detector.

The Notebook plotFactory.py contains the code used to produce the figures in [link to paper].
